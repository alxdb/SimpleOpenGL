# SimpleOpenGL
processing-esque 3D library for OpenGL in C++.

This Project has been sunsetted. Future OpenGL work will be done in https://github.com/alxdb/adbGL

# Requirements
requires GLFW

Currently only tested on mac, but source should be almost cross compatible. Minor changes to header names and macros are probably necessary, and GLEW may also be required if not on mac but it is not currently used.
